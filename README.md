## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started figuring out how to use label and input, how to make a radio button functionnal.

```html
<input type="radio" name="rating" class="input" id="input-1">
<label for="input-1" class="nb" id="one">1</label>
<input type="radio" name="rating" class="input" id="input-2">
<label for="input-2" class="nb" id="two">2</label>
<input type="radio" name="rating" class="input" id="input-3">
<label for="input-3" class="nb" id="three">3</label>
<input type="radio" name="rating" class="input" id="input-4">
<label for="input-4" class="nb" id="four">4</label>
<input type="radio" name="rating" class="input" id="input-5">
<label for="input-5" class="nb" id="five">5</label>
```

I also learned how to style a radio button, by styling the label associated to it with the attribute for.

```css
.numbers label {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    height: 50px;
    width: 50px;
    border-radius: 25px;

    background-color: #343f4b;
    color: hsl(217, 12%, 63%);
}
```

And i started doing my very first js interaction, I learned the theorical part at school 
and now i could put it into work, so im proud of how easy i figured it out.

```js
nbOne.addEventListener('click', ()=> {
    submit.addEventListener('click', ()=> {
        if (rating.style.display == 'flex') {
            rating.style.display = 'none'
            thank.style.display = 'flex'
            selection.innerHTML = '&nbsp; 1 &nbsp;'
        } else {
            rating.style.display = 'flex'
        }
    })
})
```

### Continued development

I'm gonna keep using js interaction since i think they are more or less intuitive and I want to improve
in web interaction in general, in order to be able to use it anytime.

### Useful resources

- [Useful ressource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13630229/can-i-have-an-onclick-effect-in-css) - This helped me to put a css styled onclick effect on my radio buttons, 
because the buttons weren't showing any checked state on the page.
